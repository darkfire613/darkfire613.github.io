My first view of Japan was last night, riding the Skyline into Tokyo from Narita airport. My train car was nearly empty, and I was exhausted, having followed the advice to stay awake for the entire 13-hour flight, to reset my clock and avoid jet lag.

I was running almost blind in trying to get to my AirBnB, the magnitude and import of the trip having weighed so much on me in the leading days that I was rendered almost functionless at the thought of it.
