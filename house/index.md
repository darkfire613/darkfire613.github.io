## By Owen Monsma

### 1. Narrative Alienation

In each of Danielewski's works, there is an abstraction, a distancing between the author himself and the words as they are written on the page. Within the context of the narrative itself, there is always a narrator or narrators, who exist themselves within the bounds of the story.

*House of Leaves,* for example, contains two such narrators (barring the Pelafina letters, an epistolary appendix that was later expanded in the companion novella *The Whalestoe Letters*): Johnny Truant and Zampan√≤.

Only Revolutions: By Hailey, By Sam

T50YS: Five (and more) narrators present, denoted by color

The Familiar: introduction of the narcons

### 2. Johnny is Truant

Why Johnny Truant does not exist. Not only an unreliable narrator; an absent narrator. Layers of abstraction between the true author, the purported authors, the narrative writer, and the story.

### 3. Allways Allone

Implications of Hailey and Sam, investigation into the nature of The Creep and their constant linking. Also explore the meaning of the double-l in al- words such as allways and allone (duality of meaning, alone/all one, as fulcrum of story; Derrida-esque playfulness with word phrases)

### 4. An Interruption

The use of voice(s) in 50 Year Sword, and the beginning of textual interjection, as characters and motifs force themselves into the narrative. The beginning evidence of a grander meta-narrative, and a self-reflexive commentary on such.

### 5. Familiar Patterns

Narcons: narrative constructs that seem to exist as AI authors that write based on data filtered in from the past. Reconstructing the past through analysis of the turbulence left in the wake of a life. But these narcons also start to inject more bits of past works (blue house, double-l for example). Clip #4 has green and gold O's.

### 6. VEM

Bringing it all together. Exploring the connected nature of VEM, its mentions in practically every work starting with HoL and including short pieces such as All the Lights of Midnight. Synthesizes each of the above explorations into a final thesis.
