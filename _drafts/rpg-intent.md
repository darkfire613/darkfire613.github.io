title: Tabletop RPGs and Authorial Intent
---

Explore the nature of ownership of a world in tabletop RPGs. Is it owned by the publisher of the setting/adventure? (No.) The GM of the game? (Maybe.) The players? (Not as much as it should be.)

I specifically am curious about the role of the player of a game, and how that relates to their ability to author the world, as compared to their character. The nature of meta-gaming itself hangs in the balance: the playes have more power than their character does. Should they be forced to reduce themselves to the level of character agency? I don't think so, but it depends on what kind of game you want.

A future post will also examine the role that the mechanics of the game itself play in the world of the game. I will argue that the rules of a game are often inextricable from the setting

## A Three Body Problem

The narrative of a tabletop RPG campaign arises out of three interlocking forces: first is the environment which includes the publisher of the setting, as well as the grander cultural context that the game is inderstood in; second is the role of gamemaster (GM) who consumes the environmental forces and produces a version of the world; and third is the will of the players themselves which ideally locks into a symbiosis with the GM.
