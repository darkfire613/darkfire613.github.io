title: "Alleskaar Map"

In my free time, I run a Pathfinder campaign for some old friends of mine. I use a homebrew setting known as Alleskaar, and for Christmas 2015, I decided to make a physical map for my players, to give them a deeper tie to the world.

The map was made using Photoshop, and designed to print on an 18x27" size at 300dpi, resulting in a document size of 8100x5400. I got the final map printed at [Spoonflower](http://spoonflower.com) on their canvas fabric, where conveniently one yard of fabric would perfectly fit four maps.
