In my free time, I run a Pathfinder campaign for some old friends of mine. I use a homebrew setting known as Alleskaar, and for Christmas 2015, I decided to make a physical map for my players, to give them a deeper tie to the world.

The map was made using Photoshop, and designed to print on an 18x27" size at 300dpi, resulting in a document size of 8100x5400. I got the final map printed at <a href="http://spoonflower.com">Spoonflower</a> on their canvas fabric, where conveniently one yard of fabric would perfectly fit four maps.

The map started life as a pencil sketch in my notebook, and while major changes were made to things like the river system (turns out rivers merge instead of branch as they get closer to the sea), the basic shape of the land remains remarkably similar.

I took this pencil map as a base, and used it to produce the first, crappy line drawing of the map in Illustrator, to include in the introductory document I gave my players.

Later, I remade the map using felt-tip illustration pens, to get a clean paper copy of the map that served as the master for the final version.

I scanned this into Photoshop, and then the final map took a few weeks of off-and-on work to finally complete. I owe a massive debt to <a href="http://fantasticmaps.com">Fantastic Maps</a> for his wonderful tutorials on fantasy mapmaking, and a lot of the techniques I used were drawn directly from his work.

Finally, I got the maps printed on fabric, and also created letters written to each character to accompany.
