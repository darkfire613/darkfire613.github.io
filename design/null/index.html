layout: design
title: "#NULL"

This project was to design a logo for a Dota 2 team I was briefly part of. This included making the logo and icon, as well as textures for in-game assets such as banners.

<img src = "NullLogo.png" />
<span class = "designCaption">The #NULL Logo</span>

The logo had to be easy to read, which led to the choice of a bright magenta color against a dark grey background. The stylized pound sign was notably NOT intended to evoke a Twitter hashtag; rather, it was meant to be styled after a null-type variable in a hypothetical programming language.

<img src = "HashLogo.png" />
<span class = "designCaption">The icon had to be clean and easy to identify.</span>
