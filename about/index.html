  <p>Hi, I'm Owen. I'm 20 years old, and will be until my next birthday. I like coding, design, writing, and other things. I'm a computer science major at the University of Idaho, and aspire to be an indie game developer since it's a way to combine all of my various creative pursuits. I also enjoy having opinions on things, and sometimes I share those opinions here.</p>

  <p>In my free time I also study Japanese and like playing games and talking about them. Sometimes I stream on Twitch, which you can find <a href = "http://twitch.tv/darkfire613/">here.</a></p>
