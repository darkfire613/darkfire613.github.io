title: On Destiny
---
After over a year of hype and a rumored $500 million budget, Bungie's long-awaited new sci-fi shooter/MMO-esque epic, Destiny, launched to record-breaking sales on September 9. In the week since, I've almost reached the level cap, and have sunk several evenings into playing the game with my friends online. My friend Al made a write-up of his thoughts on the game [here](http://anpetersen.me/2014/09/15/destiny-a-love-hate-story.html), so I decided to make a post with my own thoughts. I haven't played the game as much as he has, but I feel I've put in enough time to weigh in myself.

There's a lot I love about the game, and a lot that could be improved. Let's start with what they get right. The biggest, and most important, is the gunplay. Bungie has a long history with console first-person shooters, redefining the genre with Halo: Combat Evolved on the Xbox in 2001, and Destiny lives up to that pedigree. The moment-to-moment gunplay is incredibly satisfying, feeling fast-paced and frenetic without overwhelming. Pulling off two headshots with a sniper rifle before spinning and nailing an oncoming enemy with a throwing knife never fails to make you feel like a badass. The controls are tight and responsive in an almost visceral manner. This is no doubt aided by the excellent sound design. Every shot, every melee, every special ability is deployed with brilliantly crunchy sound feedback.

Aiding the combat is absolutely stunning landscape design. Bungie has always captured incredible skyboxes, and Destiny is no different. Each location the player visits (there are four large playable zones, one each on Earth, the moon, Venus, and Mars, plus the Tower, a social center where you can shop and see other players) is striking in its own way, from the Earth hanging next to a shattered space station above the moon's surface to the dense jungle-ridden ruins on Venus. Each area feels incredibly unique and gives a sense of imposing scale, a broken world filled with secrets. Unfortunately, the promise that the set design hints at doesn't quite come true, as I'll discuss in a bit.

The last thing I think Destiny does well is conveying story through design. As mentioned above, the locations feel rich in history. There are hints at the grand scope that Bungie promised everywhere, from the ever-hanging giant orb known as the Traveler to the sand-filled ruins on Mars. The aesthetics speak to this beautiful, uniquely dead world, a combination of sci-fi and mythic fantasy, with a wonderful, cohesive art direction driving it. There's a sense of mysticism about everything, about a history built more on lore and the arcane than on pure science. This is a history I would love to explore.

Bungie makes it very hard to explore, however. The story presented by the campaign missions throughout the game rarely capture the sense of scope that the environments hint at, mainly consisting of running through some areas, often backtracking over places you've visited before, deploying your Ghost into a computer, and fighting off waves of enemies that spawn immediately. Occasionally, there will be a boss fight, but these rarely require more strategy than simply aim-for-the-weak-spot. A few times, I found myself awestruck by another great vista, only to groan as I found myself fighting against the same enemies in the same patterns, all while stuff apparently happened around me. Ghost (voiced by Peter Dinklage with a performance so dull it may as well have been done by the Bungie janitor) briefly explains what's happening, both during loading screens before missions and during the missions, but it never feels like what he's describing is actually happening. There's no sense of player agency, no feeling that I'm serving any purpose in the world.

Most of the lore itself is instead found in the Grimoire Cards, rewards unlocked by completing milestones such as killing a certain number of enemies in an area. These Grimoire Cards give more details on lore, but accessing them is such a pain that even though I wanted to know more, I never bothered to look at them. They can't be found in-game, only on bungie.net or through the Destiny companion app for iOS and Android. On the web, the interface was horribly buggy, with cards often overlapping each other, preventing text from being read. The iOS experience is at least a little better, but navigating the UI is still a complex, unclear nightmare.

I touched on my biggest problem with Destiny above when talking about story. Despite being told at the beginning of the game that I am a Guardian, one of the heroic defenders of the last of humanity, it never feels like I'm actually defending anything. I drop into a place, shoot some enemies, and move on. There's no sense that the enemies (four separate races that all end up feeling quite the same: the Fallen, the Hive, the Vex, and the Cabal) are actually working towards anything. When you come across them in the wilderness, they're often just standing around, as if waiting for a Guardian to come along and kill them. Thirty seconds later, a dropship warps in, leaves another batch of 5-10 enemies, and leaves again. Occasionally, you'll find two of the groups fighting each other, but even these encounters don't give any sense of dynamic conflict.
This was one area that Bungie should have borrowed more from MMOs. Each zone should have control points. These control points could be owned by any of the four alien races, or by the Guardians. Owning the control point would give a bonus to the Guardians, like cheaper shop prices or extra missions. This would create a sense of dynamic conflict in the world, as the enemy races press in to take the points and the Guardians have to fight back to retain control. As it is, there's no sense that anything is happening beyond a game of airsoft with halloween costumes on.

Is Destiny a bad game? No. Not at all. It's a fun, solidly-crafted shooter with interesting MMO/persistent universe ideas. Being able to jump on, join my friend's fireteam, and go out and shoot enemies is a satisfying core experience. It's just a shame that with such a strong core, the meat surrounding it is so dry. Bungie promised a dynamic world with huge free-roaming zones, an epic space-faring universe with a deep mythic-sci-fi lore. Instead, we got a solid but not-outstanding shooter, great fun with friends but without the depth required to sustain interest inherently.

There is promise on the horizon though. Bungie has said time and again that the launch of Destiny is not the end. They plan to support the game with plenty of post-launch content, changing up playlists and adding strikes (the Destiny equivalent of dungeons) and raids as time goes on, plus they have two expansions planned for release in the coming months. I'm hopeful for Destiny, and I'll keep playing it. I just wish it felt more alive.

(NOTE: I have not played enough Crucible (the game's 6v6 PVP mode) to judge its quality. From what I have played, both during the beta and final launch, it's a fun experience, but an imbalanced one, without enough variety to keep my interest. Again, I'll see if that changes with Bungie's planned post-release support.)
