title: Halloween 2019&#58; Moving Shadows
---

The Halloween season is upon us, and it is with great excitement that I announce the theme for 2019: Moving Shadows. Whether cast from a candle flickering in the wind, or a distorted darkness through a doorway, a moving shadow hints at things just beyond the edges of our perception. The ill-defined shape takes hold in the mind and conjures horrors of the unknown. A shadow can only exist with light, but it also means something has blocked that light. Instinctually, we search for patterns, and deep in our minds match the twisting shapes to the nighttime predators that lurk just beyond vision.

Some ideas for projects include: camera obscura, magic lantern, zoetrope, projectors, charcoal
