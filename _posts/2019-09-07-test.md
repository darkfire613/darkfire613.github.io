title: Website Redesign
---

Wow, I redesigned my website! I'm trying to unify my image with a set of consistent typefaces and colors that I'll use across all of my personal project stuff. Definitely taking a page from Jack White's book here, where every "identity" that I have will get its own unique color.

For myself, I've chosen this awesome magenta-red color. Inspired by the [Cyanide](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Cyanide) Sublime Text 3 theme, specifically the Love color scheme in it. Typefaces are Futura for headers, and Palatino for body text.
